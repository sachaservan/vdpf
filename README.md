# Verifiable Distributed Point Functions

Implementation of VDPFs in C with a Go wrapper. See the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/580.pdf) for details.

## Dependencies 
* Go 1.13 or higher 
* OpenSSL 1.1.1f
* GNU Make
* Cmake

## Getting everything to run (tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, and MacOS)

|0) Install dependencies (Ubuntu): | 0) Install dependencies (CentOS):|
|--------------|-----------|
|```sudo apt-get install build-essential``` |  ```sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'```|
|```sudo apt-get install cmake```| ```sudo yum install cmake```|
|```sudo apt install libssl-dev```|```sudo yum install openssl-devel```|
|```sudo apt-get install golang-go```| ```sudo yum install golang```|


For optimal performance, you should compile the C code with clang (approximately 10-20 percent faster than the default on some distributions).
- Clang-11: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt install clang```.  On CentOS, ```sudo yum install clang```.
  - You'll also need llvm if you use clang. 
- LLVM-AR: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt install llvm```. On CentOS, ```sudo yum install llvm```.

### 1) Compiling the C VDPF/DPF library
```
go mod tidy
cd src && make
```

### 2a) Running tests (in C) 
```
./test
```
See also [```src/test.c```](src/test.c)

### 2b) Running tests (in Go)
```
go test
```
See also [```dpf_test.go```](dpf_test.go)
